      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got an internship where I was tasked to program a microcontroller, specifically ESP32-based M5TimerCamera. The camera is connected to an external lens and is used as a microscope to display the images taken onto a smartphone device. By joining the WiFi access point of the M5Camera and going to the IP address from the browser, images can be captured by clicking a button. Furthermore, specific settings like exposure and gain values can be changed from the web browser as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was creating a game inspired from Pacman to brush up my coding skills that I learnt on the first semester of college only to come across a road block. How will the ghosts track the player and move towards you? The solution I used is the &lt;strong&gt;Greedy Best-First Search&lt;/strong&gt;. Now before we dive into it we must first familiarize ourselves with how the ghosts move in the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
